# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**ClaudeTest** is a test/demo repository used for testing Claude's web interface capabilities. It is currently a minimal scaffold with no application code, dependencies, or build tooling.

## Repository Structure

```
ClaudeTest/
├── CLAUDE.md      # AI assistant guidance (this file)
└── README.md      # Project description
```

## Current State

- **Language/Framework:** None yet — the repository is a blank slate
- **Build System:** None configured
- **Testing:** No test framework or tests
- **Linting/Formatting:** No configuration
- **CI/CD:** No pipelines or workflows
- **Dependencies:** None

## Development Workflow

### Git

- **Remote:** `origin` hosted on GitHub (`92dl92/ClaudeTest`)
- **Default branch:** `main`
- Commits are signed with SSH keys
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages

### Adding New Code

Since this is a blank repository, any new code should include:
1. Appropriate build/dependency configuration for the chosen language
2. A linting and formatting setup
3. A test framework with at least basic test coverage
4. Updated README.md describing setup and usage

## Conventions for AI Assistants

- Read existing files before making modifications
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the requested task
- Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies or over-engineer solutions
- When adding new tooling, prefer widely adopted, well-maintained options
- Update this CLAUDE.md file when significant structural changes are made to the repository
